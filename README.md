## Holberton BnB Project

### Holberton AirBnB clone project
In this project, we implement the following:
- `BaseModel` class for instantation of AirBnB clone objects
- `User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`, `Amenity`, `Review` subclasses that inherit from `BaseModel`
- Serialization/deserialization of instances
- A storage engine for the project: `FileStorage`
- A console/command interpreter where we can instantiate, store, destroy, and update attributes of objects, as well as print out the string representation of those objects
